>By the end of this course you will earn a digital badge certifying that you understand: 👇🏻

> - What APIs are and why they are crucial to modern software development<br>
> - How to use Postman to work with APIs <br>
> - How to interact with a real-world API <br>
> - How Postman helps you incorporate APIs into your applications<br>
> - By assuming the role of a digital librarian, you'll get hands-on experience calling an API with the industry's leading API tooling and walk away with the confidence to start using APIs out in the real world. <br>

### Begin your certification Journey
This is a huge step towards your API Journey, API is relevant in all fields that why we are prioritising this collaboration with API. 
So everyone knows the basics about API and work around it.
