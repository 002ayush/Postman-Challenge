>By the end of this course you will earn a digital badge certifying that you understand: 👇🏻

> - What APIs are and why they are crucial to modern software development<br>
> - How to use Postman to work with APIs <br>
> - How to interact with a real-world API <br>
> - How Postman helps you incorporate APIs into your applications<br>
> - By assuming the role of a digital librarian, you'll get hands-on experience calling an API with the industry's leading API tooling and walk away with the confidence to start using APIs out in the real world. <br>

### Begin your certification Journey
This is a huge step towards your API Journey, API is relevant in all fields thats why we are prioritising this collaboration with API.
