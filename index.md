We have collaborated with postman so chance to grab goodies and certications from the Postman as part of this campaign. 

# How to participate the challenge

The idea is to get Postman API Fundamental Student Expert Certification [Link to register](https://academy.postman.com/path/postman-api-fundamentals-student-expert) <br>
It might ask you to create a account following clicking on the button. This course has 22 modules including Test. if you clear all 22- 28 test you will be getting certification.

## Pre-requisites: none

> You are starting in the right place! 
>There are no pre-requisites to get started - you don't even have to know what API stands for. By the end of this course you will earn a digital badge certifying that you understand:

> - What APIs are and why they are crucial to modern software development<br>
> - How to use Postman to work with APIs <br>
> - How to interact with a real-world API <br>
> - How Postman helps you incorporate APIs into your applications<br>
> - By assuming the role of a digital librarian, you'll get hands-on experience calling an API with the industry's leading API tooling and walk away with the confidence to start using APIs out in the real world. <br>

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
```
